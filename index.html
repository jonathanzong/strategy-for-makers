This is an experimental format, so before we get started I should explain how it works.
<p class="hide-on-desktop">To move foward, tap on the right side of the screen. To go backwards, tap on the left.</p><p class="hide-on-mobile">To move foward, click on the right side of the screen. To go backwards, click on the left.
<br><em>Pro tip: if you're on a laptop, you can also use the arrow keys.</em></p>

You can see where you are in the bottom-right corner of the screen, and your place is auto-saved in the background, so you won&rsquo;t lose your page.

In my opinion, the best way to read this is to add it to your homescreen on your phone. That way you can see it fullscreen. But it&rsquo;s up to you.

Alright, let&rsquo;s go!

If you ask me, it&rsquo;s a damn shame!

Back in the 80&rsquo;s and 90&rsquo;s, Porter <em>dominated</em> the world of business strategy. His theories turned the field upside down, making everyone else irrelevant overnight. It truly was a paradaigm shift.

Then something funny happened:

<em>He became a victim of his own success.</em>

Then something funny happened:

<em>He became a victim of his own success.</em>

Porter's ideas became so widely known and accepted that they started to fade into the background. Once revolutionary, now boring and basic.

---
As a result, a whole new generation of entrepreneurs has barely even heard of him. Even so, his ideas are as relevant now as ever, and are provide crucial structure to help anyone answer the question at the heart of our industry:

<center><h2 style="font-size: 2em; padding-top: 20px; font-weight: bold;">2. What is Strategy?</h2><em>(Hint: it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;operational effectiveness&rdquo;)</em></center>

---
Before Porter, most companies believed that the key to profitability was simply to do a better job than their competitors. This meant adhering to &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, hiring better employees, acquiring customers more cheaply, designing a better product, and so on.

Boston Consulting Group - the main strategy consulting firm at the time - created a name for this: the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo;. As you grow your business and gain experience, your unit costs typically go down, which causes your profit margins to go up.
<!-- TODO insert an interactive graph or visualization of this phenomenon -->

---
Porter&rsquo;s genius was to look beyond the experience curve and realize that beneath it, there is a deeper issue that sets the ultimate limit on any business&rsquo;s profitability, no matter how well they&rsquo;re executing.

To understand what Porter saw, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what is really going on inside a business.

---
A business is a system that performs a set of activities to create a product and sell it to customers. We call a business &ldquo;profitable&rdquo; when the cost of performing the activities is less than the value it takes in from customers.

The underlying assumption in the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; is that the main way to grow your profits is to shrink your costs. That&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s not the whole truth.

---
The most interesting (and profitable) businesses don&rsquo;t just perform the same activities more cheaply than their competitors - they choose an entirely <em>different</em> set of activities.

Let&rsquo;s see how this works in practice, using one of Porter&rsquo;s favorite examples...

<img src="Ikea_logo.svg" class="pg-ikea-logo">





Before Ikea, most furniture stores were located inside cities and towns. When you walk in, a salesperson greets you and walks you through the medium-sized store, helping you make a buying decision. The selection was limited, but there were catalogs and extensive customization options. Unless it was a high-end designer store, the furniture had a classic look and was built to last.

---
If you owned one of these stores and followed the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; philosophy, you&rsquo;d probably focus on reducing your costs. You might try to negotiate better deals from your furniture suppliers, lower your rent, and keep wages low. You&rsquo;d also try to bring in new customers TV and newspaper advertising, and draw new customers in by having sales events and cutting prices. If it worked, you&rsquo;d be able to open up new locations and build brand awareness.

In short, you&rsquo;d try to do the same thing as everyone else - just a little bit better.

---
Obviously that&rsquo;s not what Ikea chose to do, and now they are the largest furniture retailer in the world.

They started by focusing on a very specific type of customer that they felt were underserved by the existing furniture retailers: price-conscious buyers that also care about design. Then they designed a system of activities tailored to this segment&rsquo;s unique needs, and ruthlessly throwing away much of the conventional industry wisdom.

Let&rsquo;s break down their choices.

---
Instead of relying on salespeople and catalogs to help you decide what to buy, Ikea&rsquo;s entire selection is on display in every store, accompanied by clear signage and informative catalogs. In case you need one, there are a few salespeople in every section, but their assistance is by no means necessary.

---
Instead of requiring an expensive shipping fee from the store to your house, every Ikea store comes with it&rsquo;s own warehouse. Each item is flat-packed into boxes that you load and take home yourself. Ikea has chosen to do this because they know that their customers would rather do it themselves than pay to have them do it for you.

---
Instead of buying small retail locations inside cities and towns, they realized that furniture-buying is a rare event, that people are willing to make a trip. So they chose to construct giant stores on cheap land outside major metropolitan areas.

Because it&rsquo;s such a trip, and their stores are so isolated, they decided to install a restaurant and daycare center inside their store for parents with young children.

---
These are just a few examples from the enormous set of unique features of the Ikea experience. As you can see, their success hasn&rsquo;t come from doing what everyone else does, but better. It stems from the fact that they chose <em>different</em> things to do.
