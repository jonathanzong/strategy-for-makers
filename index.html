If you ask me, it&rsquo;s a damn shame!

By ignoring Porter, we&rsquo;re missing out on some of the most powerful and elegant frameworks out there to help us make strategic choices, and answer the question at the very foundation of everything we do...

<em style="font-size: 1.7rem; line-height: 2.2rem">&ldquo;How can businesses grow profits in spite of all the forces that conspire to keep it from them?&rdquo;</em>

---
If you Google &ldquo;Michael Porter&rdquo;, you&rsquo;ll learn the basics:<ul class="pg-porter-basics"><li>He started teaching at Harvard Business School in the 80&rsquo;s</li><li>Published several books and papers</li><li>Quickly emerged as the dominant thinker of his field: Strategy.</li></ul>

---
His work has been cited tens of thousands of times, he&rsquo;s consulted with hundreds of companies, and was named &ldquo;the Godfather of Strategy&rdquo; by The Economist.

There&rsquo;s no denying it - Porter is one of the most influential business minds of all time.

---
To put it in perspective, let&rsquo;s look at Porter&rsquo;s &ldquo;h-index&rdquo;. The h-index is a measure of how often an academic&rsquo;s work is cited. The more citations your work gets, the bigger an impact it had on your field.

According to the creator of the h-index, an academic with a score of 20 is a &ldquo;successful&rdquo; scientist. 40 is an &ldquo;outstanding&rdquo; scientist. 60 is a &ldquo;truly unique individual&rdquo;.

Guess what Porter&rsquo;s h-index is? 121!

---
At this point, you might be thinking &ldquo;damn, I need to hear what this guy has to say!&rdquo;

There&rsquo;s just one problem...

---
As you work your way through Porter&rsquo;s oeuvre, you might find that it&rsquo;s a tough nut to crack.

The thing is, Porter&rsquo;s a true academic at heart, and his books weren&rsquo;t intended for mass audiences. He didn&rsquo;t just want to write a book, he wanted to create an entire system of thought, almost like a modern-day Kant or Hegel.

---
My advice? Unless you&rsquo;re a budding business academic, skip the books and start with a neat summary of his ideas. Then, maybe read a few of his most critical papers. In my experience, that&rsquo;s enough to start thinking differently about the business problems you face.

Conveniently, that&rsquo;s also exactly what the rest of this essay provides: a neat summary of Porter&rsquo;s key ideas, and a reading list with links to his most important articles.

Let&rsquo;s dive in!

<h2>1. What is Strategy?</h2><em>(Hint: it&rsquo;s not &ldquo;operational effectiveness&rdquo;)</em>

---
Before Porter, most companies believed that the key to profitability was simply to do a better job than their competitors. This meant adhering to &ldquo;best practices&rdquo;, hiring better employees, acquiring customers more cheaply, designing a better product, and so on.

Boston Consulting Group - the main strategy consulting firm at the time - created a name for this: the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo;. As you grow your business and gain experience, your unit costs typically go down, which causes your profit margins to go up.

---
Porter&rsquo;s genius was to look beyond the experience curve and realize that beneath it, there is a deeper issue that sets the ultimate limit on any business&rsquo;s profitability, no matter how well they&rsquo;re executing.

To understand what Porter saw, let&rsquo;s take a closer look at what is really going on inside a business.

---
A business is a system that performs a set of activities to create a product and sell it to customers. We call a business &ldquo;profitable&rdquo; when the cost of performing the activities is less than the value it takes in from customers.

The underlying assumption in the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; is that the main way to grow your profits is to shrink your costs. That&rsquo;s true, but it&rsquo;s not the whole truth.

---
The most interesting (and profitable) businesses don&rsquo;t just perform the same activities more cheaply than their competitors - they choose an entirely <em>different</em> set activities.

Let&rsquo;s see how this works in practice, using one of Porter&rsquo;s favorite examples...

<img src="Ikea_logo.svg" class="pg-ikea-logo">





Before Ikea, most furniture stores were located inside cities and towns. When you walk in, a salesperson greets you and walks you through the medium-sized store, helping you make a buying decision. The selection was limited, but there were catalogs and extensive customization options. Unless it was a high-end designer store, the furniture had a classic look and was built to last.

---
If you owned one of these stores and followed the &ldquo;experience curve&rdquo; philosophy, you&rsquo;d probably focus on reducing your costs. You might try to negotiate better deals from your furniture suppliers, lower your rent, and keep wages low. You&rsquo;d also try to bring in new customers TV and newspaper advertising, and draw new customers in by having sales events and cutting prices. If it worked, you&rsquo;d be able to open up new locations and build brand awareness.

In short, you&rsquo;d try to do the same thing as everyone else - just a little bit better.

---
Obviously that&rsquo;s not what Ikea chose to do, and now they are the largest furniture retailer in the world.

They started by focusing on a very specific type of customer that they felt were underserved by the existing furniture retailers: price-conscious buyers that also care about design. Then they designed a system of activities tailored to this segment&rsquo;s unique needs, and ruthlessly throwing away much of the conventional industry wisdom.

Let&rsquo;s break down their choices.

---
Instead of relying on salespeople and catalogs to help you decide what to buy, Ikea&rsquo;s entire selection is on display in every store, accompanied by clear signage and informative catalogs. In case you need one, there are a few salespeople in every section, but their assistance is by no means necessary.

---
Instead of requiring an expensive shipping fee from the store to your house, every Ikea store comes with it&rsquo;s own warehouse. Each item is flat-packed into boxes that you load and take home yourself. Ikea has chosen to do this because they know that their customers would rather do it themselves than pay to have them do it for you.

---
Instead of buying small retail locations inside cities and towns, they realized that furniture-buying is a rare event, that people are willing to make a trip. So they chose to construct giant stores on cheap land outside major metropolitan areas.

Because it&rsquo;s such a trip, and their stores are so isolated, they decided to install a restaurant and daycare center inside their store for parents with young children.

---
These are just a few examples from the enormous set of unique features of the Ikea experience. As you can see, their success hasn&rsquo;t come from doing what everyone else does, but better. It stems from the fact that they chose <em>different</em> things to do.
